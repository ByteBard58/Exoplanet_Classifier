    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>
        The <b>Exoplanet Classifier </b> is a project developed by <b>Team Ontohin 4b</b> for the
        <b>NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of this web app is to predict new exoplanet’s status
        (<b>CONFIRMED</b>, <b>CANDIDATE</b>, <b>FALSE POSITIVE</b>) by evaluating user-given inputs.
    </p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        The user-given data is sent to the model via a Flask API endpoint.
        Then, the model predicts the classes and also returns a probability for each class
        (which you can see after hitting the “Predict” button).
    </p>

    <p>
        We have used the widely known <b>Scikit-learn</b> library to build it from the ground up.
        More info about the ML part can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/ByteBard58/Exoplanet_Classifier/blob/main/README.md",target="_blank">README file</a> of the repository.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is one of the most widely used models provided by Scikit-learn and also very suitable for our objective.
        It predicts the result in three different classes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>CONFIRMED (2)</b> → The disposition represents a confirmed exoplanet.</li>
        <li><b>CANDIDATE (1)</b> → The disposition is neither a confirmed exoplanet nor a false positive. It requires
            further calculation to determine its actual status.</li>
        <li><b>FALSE POSITIVE (0)</b> → The disposition does not represent an exoplanet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The model also returns a probability (up to 3 decimal digits) of its prediction for each of those 3 classes.
    </p>

    <h2>User Inputs</h2>
    <p>
        The model is trained on 14 different features (including the output column) sourced from
        NASA’s Kepler Object of Interest dataset. To run the prediction, the user needs to provide
        13 different values (all in real numbers) as input. Here is a list of them:

    <h2>Things to Keep in Mind</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No ML model is perfectly accurate — the same goes for this one.</li>
        <li>We tried to use more than just the KOI dataset. We tested with more data from other open-source datasets
            provided by NASA and its partners. Unfortunately, those introduced more noise and caused overfitting.</li>
        <li>Within the short time period, we could not come up with a better solution, so we continued with just one
            dataset.</li>
    </ul>

        Thank you for trying out our work! We hope you enjoyed the concept and our idea to solve this astronomical
        challenge with the power of machine learning.
