# The Exoplanet Classifier 🪐

> Welcome to my enhanced fork of **The Exoplanet Classifier**. Originally developed with my teammates from **Ontohin 4b** for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**, this project now represents the upgraded and research-extended version of that submission. To check out the original repository, click [**here**](https://github.com/Ontohin-4b/The_Exoplanet_Classifier).   
> 
> The original repository remains archived under [**Ontohin 4b**](https://github.com/Ontohin-4b) and licensed as such. This fork exists purely for further research, experimentation, and personal development to make the classifier far more powerful and accurate than the hackathon version.

A robust, data-driven Machine Learning tool that classifies whether a given set of transit data corresponds to a **confirmed exoplanet**, **false positive**, or **candidate**.  
This version blends the strengths of **ensemble learning** with extensive preprocessing, imputation, and class balancing, resulting in a more stable and generalizable model.

## Project Overview

NASA’s exoplanet survey missions (Kepler, K2, and others) have generated thousands of data points using **the transit method** — tracking dips in starlight caused by orbiting planets.  
These datasets contain both **confirmed exoplanets** and **false positives**, and the aim of this project is to build an AI classifier capable of making preliminary predictions on new candidates.

The classifier runs inside a **Flask-powered web interface**, allowing anyone — from students to researchers — to enter transit parameters and instantly receive a prediction.  

The goal is to provide a *scientifically meaningful, intuitive, and educational experience* for users interested in exoplanet research.

## 🐳 Run the app directly via Dockerhub Image

I have used Docker to containerize the Exoplanet Classifier in this new fork. The [**Dockerhub repository**](https://hub.docker.com/r/bytebard101/exoplanet_classifier) allows anyone with any operating system or other system configuration to easily run the app.

The image is built on both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures, so that it can run on almost all major computers and servers. You can run the app easily by using the Dockerhub Image. Here's how you can do it:
1. Install [**Docker Desktop**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and sign-in. Make sure the app is functioning properly.
  
2. Open Terminal and run:
```bash
docker pull bytebard101/exoplanet_classifier
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 bytebard101/exoplanet_classifier:latest
```
3. If your machine faces a port conflict, you will need to assign another port. Try to run this:
```bash
docker run --rm -p 5001:5000 bytebard101/exoplanet_classifier:latest
```
> If you followed Step 2 and the command ran successfully, then **DO NOT** follow this step.
4. The app will be live at localhost:5000. Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) (or [http://127.0.0.1:5001](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) if you followed Step 3).

Check [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) to learn more about Docker and it's commands.

## Model Details

### Architecture
The upgraded classifier uses a **stacking ensemble** combining multiple base models with a meta-classifier:

- **Base Models:**
  - `RandomForestClassifier`
    - `n_estimators=1000`
    - `max_depth=None`
    - `class_weight="balanced"`
  - `XGBClassifier`
    - `n_estimators=1000`
    - `max_depth=None`
    - `learning_rate=0.5`
- **Meta-classifier:**
  - `LogisticRegression`
    - `solver="saga"`
    - `penalty="l2"`
    - `C=0.1`
    - `class_weight="balanced"`
    - `max_iter=5000`

The stacking classifier uses **5-fold cross-validation** internally and passes original features to the meta-classifier for better learning.

---

### Preprocessing Pipeline
Before feeding data into the model, the following preprocessing steps are applied via a `Pipeline`:

1. **Imputation:** `SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")` to handle missing values.  
2. **Scaling:** `StandardScaler` to normalize features.  
3. **Class Balancing:** `SMOTE` (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to address class imbalance.  
4. **Model Training:** Stacking ensemble as described above.

---

### Features
The model uses 13 transit and orbital-related features, including:

- Orbital period, transit epoch, transit depth  
- Planetary radius, semi-major axis, inclination  
- Equilibrium temperature, insolation, impact parameter  
- Radius ratios, density ratios, duration ratios  
- Number of observed transits

---

### Labels
Targets are mapped as follows:

- `0` → FALSE POSITIVE or REFUTED  
- `1` → CANDIDATE  
- `2` → CONFIRMED

---

### Data Sources
- [Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI)](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative)  
- [K2 Planets and Candidates](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=k2pandc)

---

### Training Workflow
- Train/test split: **2/3 training, 1/3 testing** with stratification on class labels.  
- Pipeline is trained end-to-end in `fit.py`.  
- Hyperparameters and model choices were extensively tested in [research.ipynb](https://github.com/ByteBard58/Exoplanet_Classifier/blob/main/research.ipynb), which served as a sandbox for experimentation and optimization.  
- Final trained pipeline is saved as `models/pipe.pkl` and column order as `models/column_names.pkl`.

---

### Evaluation

Here is the classification report:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 0 (FALSE POSITIVE / REFUTED) | 0.82 | 0.81 | 0.82 | 1718 |
| 1 (CANDIDATE) | 0.56 | 0.55 | 0.56 | 1118 |
| 2 (CONFIRMED) | 0.79 | 0.81 | 0.80 | 1687 |

**Overall Metrics:**

- **Accuracy:** 0.75  
- **Macro Avg:** Precision = 0.72, Recall = 0.72, F1-score = 0.72  
- **Weighted Avg:** Precision = 0.74, Recall = 0.75, F1-score = 0.75  

This demonstrates that the upgraded stacking classifier maintains strong performance on confirmed and false positive classes, with room for improvement on candidate predictions.  
The model balances **accuracy, generalization, and class fairness**, making it reliable for preliminary exoplanet classification tasks.

---

### Note 
Despite extensive experimentation, this represents the current performance ceiling achievable with the available data.  
Numerous optimizations were explored — including hyperparameter tuning, feature scaling, class rebalancing, and ensemble variations — yet further improvements beyond ~0.75 accuracy were not observed.  
This indicates a **data limitation rather than a model limitation**, as the features may not carry additional separable information for higher classification accuracy.  

The research process behind this version involved significant model testing and fine-tuning efforts (see `research.ipynb`).  
 
**Suggestions and improvements are highly welcome** — contributions or insights from the community could help push the model beyond its present boundary.
